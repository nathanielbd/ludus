Now that we have seen a few examples of our optimization framework in action, let us review the main results of our research. 

Firstly, we can see that the optimization framework yielded some very useful results from a game design perspective. Given a small, yet representative, set of cards, our methods were able to find a much more balanced configuration, that would likely be a far more enjoyable game to play. 

We have contributed a simple auto battler game, and its associated tooling to the literature. Given the recent nature of this genre, we believe this is an important contribution that will aid future research in the area.
