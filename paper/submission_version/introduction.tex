\subsection{Auto Battler games}

% are auto battlers popular?
Auto battlers are a new and wildly popular genre of online game.
\textit{Auto Chess} released in January of 2019 \cite{autochess}, and
within that same month was regularly seeing 70,000 concurrent players
\cite{auto-chess-what-and-why}. By June, \textit{Dota Underlords} and
\textit{Teamfight Tactics} were among the most popular online games in
the world \cite{autobattler-popularity}. Since then, entries like
\textit{Hearthstone: Battlegrounds} and \textit{Storybook Brawl} have
further refined the genre \cite{hearthstone-battlegrounds,
storybook-brawl}.


% what are auto battlers? how do they work?

In an auto battler, a number of players (typically eight) compete to
build the best deck through a number of rounds. Each round consists of
a deck-building phase and a battle. In the deck-building phase, each
player improves their deck by selecting cards from a shared pool. In
the battle phase, two players' decks compete automatically. Players
who loose too many of these battles are eliminated. Play proceeds in
rounds until all but one player are eliminated. The remaining player
wins.

Auto battlers are in many ways similar to deck-building collectible
card games like \textit{Magic: the Gathering} or \textit{Yu-Gi-Oh!}
\cite{magic-the-gathering, yugioh-tcg}. In collectible card games, a
battle between two decks is called a game. Because it encompasses and
affects multiple games, the deck-building process is called the
\newterm{metagame.}
% TODO: finish this thought. (you need it to justify the examples in
% the next section.)

\subsection{Balance and Metagame Health}
% what does it mean for a metagame to be healthy?

% what's the state of the art on how to get there? why isn't it good
% enough?

% what goes wrong when the current approaches fail? (you lose players,
% don't gain new players, so you lose money)

\subsection{Our work}
% in this paper, we...

% introduce an auto battler game

% present an approximation algorithm to more efficiently compute
% decks' average payoffs within a large metagame

% consider some metrics for evaluating metagame health in that game

% use off-the-shelf optimization techniques to balance for those metrics

% show off some experiments we did to balance for said metrics
