% I'm writing this intro to be read following the abstract.

Deck-building games are a genre of card games where each player
constructs a deck by combining cards from a heterogeneous pool of
cards, often called a \newterm{set,} according to some
\newterm{deck-building rules.} Players then \newterm{pilot} their
decks in games against other players' decks. Because it takes place
prior to and effects the outcomes of multiple individual games, the
deck-building process is often called the \newterm{metagame.}
Metagames are said to be \newterm{healthy} when there are many diverse
\enquote{archetypes}, or categories of decks, available for players to
choose between, and when most games between these decks are
fun. Deck-building games pose a challenge for game designers, since a
relatively small number of cards can be combined into a large number
of possible decks, which in turn can be paired into an even larger
number of match-ups. Human playtesting has repeatedly failed to
identify card designs or sets which lead to unhealthy metagames.
% TODO: do we need to cite sources?
% possible examples:
% - hearthstone's "miracle rogue" and "grim patron" metagames
% - magic: the gathering's "combo winter," "affinity," "caw-blade" and "oko" metagames
% - yu-gi-oh, i assume
% - to a lesser extent, "good boy" in storybook brawl
Even when it successfully identifies and fixes unhealthy metagames,
human playtesting requires significant labor and time from a number of
skilled players, and is therefore expensive. In this paper, we attempt
to reduce this cost by automating the balancing process.
% this is where I cut off because I'm going to a movie.
