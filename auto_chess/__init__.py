"""An auto-chess game

FIXME: detect case where zero-attack monsters will cause an infinite
       battle and return a tie

FIXME: do something sensible for negative-attack monsters - clamp to zero?

FIXME: some way for monster hooks to get a handle on the monster
       they're fighting.

You are intended to create cards with interesting abilities by
subclassing Card, and defining methods on its various hooks. Each of
these hooks will take at least three arguments:
- The Card as self. This must be immutable, as it is shared between
  many monsters and many games.
- The Monster, which is a mutable in-game representation.
- The Game, a mutable representation of the game state.
The game's Game.active_player and Game.opponent methods will return
Player objects denoting the monster's controller and opponent,
respectively.

Generally, you should not subclass Monster, as they are intended only
as proxy objects for accessing Cards. You may, however, store
arbitrary mutable properties within a Monster. You should not mutate
the private properties defined in Monster below, nor overwrite its
card.

If you want do define a new hook on Card, you must:

- define a method on Card which takes as arguments: self, monster,
  game, followed by any others.
- define a method on _Monster which takes as arguments: self, game,
  followed by any others, and invokes the associated method on
  Monster._card.
- Find the appropriate spot in Game to invoke that method. At that
  spot:
  1. get a handle on the monster and its controlling player
  2. construct a local function of no arguments which invokes the
     appropriate method on the monster.
  3. pass that function to Game._call_with_active_player.
  This will arrange for the game's Game.active_player and
  Game.opponent methods to return appropriate values.
