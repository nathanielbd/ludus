"""An auto-chess game

FIXME: detect case where zero-attack monsters will cause an infinite
       battle and return a tie

FIXME: do something sensible for negative-attack monsters - clamp to
       zero?

You are intended to create cards with interesting abilities by
subclassing Card, and defining methods on its various hooks. Each of
these hooks will take at least three arguments:
- The Card as self. This must be immutable, as it is shared between
  many monsters and many games.
- The Monster, which is a mutable in-game representation.
- The GameState, a namedtuple which includes handles on various
  mutable aspects of the game state.
  - GameState.player is a Player object for the controller of the
    monster whose method is being invoked. Depending on the context,
    that monster may or may not appear in that Player's monsters
    deque.
  - GameState.opponent is a Player object for the other player.
  - GameState.defender is the other Monster involved in battle, or
    None in contexts where no Monster vs Monster combat is
    happening. If GameState.defender is not None, that monster will
    not appear in the Gamestate.opponent.monsters deque.
  - GameState.print_output is a boolean, which if True means verbose
    output should be printed to stdout about the progress of the game.

Generally, you should not subclass Monster, as they are intended only
as proxy objects for accessing Cards. You may, however, store
arbitrary mutable properties within a Monster. You should not mutate
the private properties defined in Monster below, nor overwrite its
card.

If you want do define a new hook on Card, you must:

- define a method on Card which takes as arguments: self, monster,
  gamestate, followed by any others.
- define a method on Monster which takes as arguments: self,
  gamestate, followed by any others, and invokes the associated method
  on Monster._card.
- Find the appropriate spot in Game to invoke that method. At that
  spot:
  1. construct a GameState object with handles on each Player in
     player and opponent. If during combat, also put a handle on the
     other monster in defender.
  2. invoke the method on Monster, with the GameState and any other
     arguments.
