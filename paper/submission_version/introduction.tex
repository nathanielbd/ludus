% I'm writing this intro to be read following the abstract.

Deck-building games are a genre of card games where each player
constructs a deck by combining cards from a heterogeneous pool, often
called a \newterm{set,} according to some \newterm{deck-building
  rules.} Players then \newterm{pilot} their decks in games against
other players' decks by strategically selecting which cards to play as
each unique game unfolds. Because it takes place prior to and effects
the outcomes of multiple individual games, the deck-building process
is often called the \newterm{metagame.}  Metagames are said to be
\newterm{healthy} when there are many diverse \enquote{archetypes}, or
categories of decks, available for players to choose between, and when
most games between these decks are fun. Deck-building games pose a
challenge for game designers, since a relatively small number of cards
can be combined into a large number of possible decks, which in turn
can be paired into an even larger number of match-ups. Human
playtesting has repeatedly failed to identify card designs or sets
that lead to unhealthy metagames.
% TODO: do we need to cite sources?
% possible examples:
% - hearthstone's "miracle rogue" and "grim patron" metagames
% - magic: the gathering's "combo winter," "affinity," "caw-blade" and "oko" metagames
% - yu-gi-oh, i assume
% - to a lesser extent, "good boy" in storybook brawl
Even when it does successfully identify and fix unhealthy metagames,
human playtesting is often prohibitively expensive, requiring
significant labor and time from a number of skilled players. In this
paper, we attempt to reduce this cost by automating the balancing
process.
% this is where I cut off because I'm going to a movie.
